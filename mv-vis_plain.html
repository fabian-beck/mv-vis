<h2>Start</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This tutorial is an introduction to data visualization that focuses
on the explorative analysis of multivariate (tabular) data and uses
interactive examples in R. The tutorial is target at learners of all
disciplines—no programming experience required.</p>
</blockquote>
<div id="section-motivation" class="section level3">
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>The <strong>goal of data visualization</strong> is to make data
readable. Whereas statistics focuses on summarizing data and testing
hypothesis, visualization is more explorative. With a visualization, we
can get an overview of the data, identify frequent patterns and rare
outliers, inspect quality issues, and relate individual data points to
the overall data. This is not meant to replace a statistic analysis, but
to complement it.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we focus on <strong>multivariate data</strong>—data
that can be represented as tables—because it is one of the most common
data types and its visualization is relevant across nearly all
scientific areas and domains. The rows of the table usually list the
data items, while the columns provide different data variables recorded
for each item.</p>
<p><strong>Tables</strong> in their plain version are a great tool to
show small amounts of data, as well as to edit and transform the data.
However, they hardly provide a good overview or reveal patterns and
outliers.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-example" class="section level3">
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>For instance, the table below shows study results where participants
answered <strong>how appropriate a behavior is in a certain
situation</strong> (from 0 – <em>low</em> to 9 – <em>high
appropriateness</em>). It is easy to read a specific value from the
table relating to a pair of behavior and situation. An example is that
<em>sleeping</em> in <em>church</em> is not considered appropriate
(value: 1.77). But what is the most appropriate behavior in
<em>church</em>? What is generally a favorable behavior in most
situations? Are there other situations rated similarly to
<em>church</em>? These questions are harder to answer with the plain
table, already in rather small example like this.</p>
<p><img src="images/behavior-situation_table.png" alt="Table showing appropriateness values for all behavior-situation pairs" width="100%"/></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Source:</em> “Behavioral Appropriateness and Situational
Constraint as Dimensions of Social Behavior” Price, R.H. and Bouffard,
D.L. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 1974, Vol. 30, No.4,
579-586; via: <a
href="http://research.jagoda.ca/j/data-sketches/index.html"
class="uri">http://research.jagoda.ca/j/data-sketches/index.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>By using colored squares as cells, we can <strong>transform the table
into a visualization</strong>. We use orange for low values and green
for high values. Additionally, we vary the sizes of the squares
according to the appropriateness to make it even easier to read, also
considering that some users might be red-green blind. This is a
straightforward way to visualize multivariate data, but a quite powerful
approach already. For instance, we can now see that <em>job
interview</em> has very similar values as <em>church</em>, but
<em>park</em> and <em>own room</em> are rather the opposite.</p>
<p><img src="images/behavior-situation_table_visual.png" alt="Visualization showing appropriateness values for all behavior-situation pairs as colored and scaled squares" width="70%"/></p>
<p>This is just one example to motivate that the use of visualization
can be a powerful tool for data analysis. There are also other
visualization methods for such tabular data, some that scale to much
larger datasets. We will explain some important ones in this tutorial
step by step.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-structure-of-this-tutorial" class="section level3">
<h3>Structure of this Tutorial</h3>
<p>As the <strong>main content of this tutorial</strong>, we will
introduce you to multivariate data and how to visualize such
information. After clarifying the type of data (<a
href="#section-multivariate-data">Multivariate Data</a>), we will first
look at visualizations that visualize the data from each variable
separately (<a href="#section-univariate-analysis">Univariate
Analysis</a>). Then, we also discuss visualization that show multiple
variables at the same time (<a
href="#section-multivariate-analysis">Multivariate Analysis</a>). Along
introducing the visualization techniques, we will also discuss their
advantages and limitations, as well as their potential to be
misinterpreted or misused.</p>
<p>Using R, we will give practical examples how to create these
visualization with a few lines of code. We include short interactive
quizzes to immediately allow you to check whether you understood the
discussed content and can use the visualization to get insights.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-multivariate-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Multivariate Data</h2>
<p>Before presenting and discussing different visualization options, we
first explain what exactly we consider as <em>multivariate data</em>. We
also introduce a specific dataset that we use as our running example
throughout this tutorial.</p>
<p>Multivariate data, as focused in this tutorial, concerns any data
that can be represented as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data items</strong> that represent real-world objects,
persons, organization, etc., and</li>
<li><strong>Variables</strong> that characterize these items and can be
considered as properties or attributes of the items.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since all items of one dataset are described along the same
variables, it is important that the items belong to the same class of
objects. Otherwise, it would be hard to apply the same variables. For
instance, mixing persons with countries in one dataset, it would be hard
to find any attributes that apply to both classes of items alike.</p>
<p>Aside identifiers and names, we can discern between two main data
types for those variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Numeric</strong> variables, which encode some type of number
(e.g., positive integers for quantities, float numbers 0.0 to 1.0 for
fractions).</li>
<li><strong>Categorical</strong> variables, which assign a data item to
a certain category (e.g., a country item to a region category).</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, these two types encode quantitative and qualitative
information. While numeric variables can be sorted in increasing or
decreasing order, categorical variables often cannot. Please note that,
sometimes, categorical variables are encoded as numbers (e.g., a numeric
country code)—analyzing them as numeric variables would result in
invalid results.</p>
<div id="section-our-sample-dataset" class="section level3">
<h3>Our Sample Dataset</h3>
<p>We have selected a dataset that is easy to understand, yet of high
relevance to many disciplines. It lists the <strong>countries of the
world</strong> as data items and characterizes them along <strong>social
and economic properties in 2010</strong> as variables. The data is based
on free material from <a
href="https://www.gapminder.org">GAPMINDER.ORG</a>, CC-BY LICENSE.</p>
<p>Let us load our dataset with R and display it as a table. We import
it from a <strong>csv</strong> file, a simple file format for tables
that consists of of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values"><strong>c</strong>omma-<strong>s</strong>eparated
<strong>v</strong>alues</a>, including also the table header in the
first line of the file. In order to see the top 5 rows, we use the
function head().</p>
<!-- todo: load the data from a relative path instead of a global fixed source -->
<pre class="r"><code>world &lt;- read.csv(&quot;https://git.uni-due.de/spdeartj/data-campus/-/raw/master/data/world_dataset.csv&quot;, header=TRUE)

<p>The dataset contains mostly numeric variables, but also a column with
an identifier (the country name) and one with a categorical variable
(the region). In detail, we have included the following variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>country</code> (identifier) – the name of the country</li>
<li><code>region</code> (categorical) – the geographic region the
country is located</li>
<li><code>population</code> (numeric) – the number of inhabitants of a
country</li>
<li><code>income</code> (numeric) – the gross domestic product (i.e.,
the average economic production) per citizen in international
dollars</li>
<li><code>health_expenditure</code> (numeric) – the average health
spending per citizen in USD</li>
<li><code>life_expectancy</code> (numeric) – the expected number of
years a newborn child would live under current conditions</li>
<li><code>babies_per_woman</code> (numeric) – the fertility rate, which
is number of babies that would be born per woman under current
conditions</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also observe some missing values (<code>NA</code> – <em>not
available</em>). It is a common problem in all real world data that, due
to different reasons, there are gaps and quality issues in the data. We
intentionally kept the countries with such missing data to literally
draw a more realistic picture of the data. Please note, however, that
the R scripts in the following often produce warnings relating to these
missing values. But these are good reminders that, when interpreting the
visualizations, we need to be careful as not all data items might be
present.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-univariate-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Univariate Analysis</h2>
<p>Every variable describes a relevant attribute of the data items.
Hence, analyzing the data along only one variable at first
(<em>univariate analysis</em>), might already provide relevant insights.
For instance, we could learn how the items are distributed across a
numeric scale (e.g., with a peak around a certain value or evenly across
all possible values) or discover noteworthy outliers and extreme values.
We will present some simple, yet powerful visualizations to explore such
characteristics.</p>
<div id="section-item-bars" class="section level3">
<h3>Item Bars</h3>
<p>A set of numeric values can be generally represented as <strong>bar
charts</strong>. This type of diagram is also applicable here and
provides maybe the simplest visualization of a single variable. In such
a diagram, each data item is represented by a bar and the height of the
bar encodes the respective numeric value.</p>
<p>We can test this, for instance, for the variable
<code>life_expectancy</code> using the following code. (Please click
<em>Run Code</em> to see the diagram.)</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="ItemBars" data-caption="Code"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>library(ggplot2)

ggplot(head(world), aes(x = country, y = life_expectancy)) +
        geom_col()</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":7,"fig.height":5,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":672,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"default","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>The code starts with importing the program library <a
href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a>, a popular
visualization library for R. Then, we can generate a bar chart using the
function <code>ggplot()</code> with <code>geom_bar()</code>. First, we
provide the data (here, <code>head(world)</code>—only the first five
rows to not overload the diagram) and specify the
<strong>aes</strong><em>thetic mapping</em> (here, the mapping of the
data to x- and y-axis). Second, we define a
<strong>geom</strong><em>etric layer</em> as bars or
<strong>col</strong><em>umns</em>, respectively
(<code>geom_col</code>).</p>
<p><em>Please note that we assume here the data is still loaded—in this
and the following code blocks, for brevity, we do not repeat code that
has been executed before like loading of data or libraries.</em></p>
<p><strong>TASK:</strong> You can change the above code and run it
again. Please load <strong>all</strong> countries and analyze the data
ranges.</p>

<div id="section-histograms" class="section level3">
<h3>Histograms</h3>
<p>With the above diagram, we can hence read specific values and inspect
the data range of a certain variable. While this is a good starting
point, we might also want to understand whether the data distribution
has a certain peak around a value, which is hard to see in the example
above. To this end, histograms show how frequent certain values are. A
typical example for a historgram, which most likely everybody has seen
in school or at university, is a distribution of grades published after
an exam.</p>
<p>When there are discrete steps in the data—for instance, the steps of
a grading scale—, each bar can represent one of these steps. However,
for continuous numeric variables, it does not make sense to include a
bar for every different value because, most likely, none of the values
is repeated. Instead we use <strong>bins</strong> of values that cover a
certain range, each of the same width. For generating a histogram, we
can either specify the number of bins we want to have or the width of
the bins. Here, we use the number of bins as this can be set
independently of the scale of the variable.</p>
<p>For our sample dataset, we can generate a histogram for the variable
<code>life_expectancy</code> as follows.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="Histogram"
data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1"
data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>ggplot(world, aes(x = life_expectancy)) +
        geom_histogram(bins = 10)</code></pre>

</div>
<p>Again, we use <code>ggplot()</code>, but now with
<code>geom_histogram()</code> to select the right type of diagram. We
set the number of <code>bins</code> to 10.</p>
<p><strong>TASK:</strong> In the above code, please change the variable
to <code>babies_per_woman</code> and analyze how the distribution
adapts.</p>
<div class="panel panel-default">
<div data-label="MCHistogram" class="tutorial-question panel-body">
<div id="MCHistogram-answer_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-boxplots" class="section level3">
<h3>Boxplots</h3>
<p>Boxplots even aggregate the data more, by computing statistical
properties of the numerical data distributions and visualizing these.
Important to understand is that the visualized properties are based on
sorting all values that appear for the variable and then cutting them
into four equally-sized parts, the <strong>quarters</strong>. For
visualization as a boxplot, we are specifically interested in the values
at the borders of the quarters, which are called
<strong>quartiles</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First quartile</strong> – the value at the border of the
first and second quarter</li>
<li><strong>Second quartile (median)</strong> – the value in the middle
of the sorted list at the border of the second and third quarter</li>
<li><strong>Third quartile</strong> – the value at the border of the
third and fourth quarter</li>
</ul>
<p>Describing the distribution along the quartiles gives a good summary
where there is a peak (mostly, around the median) and where the central
50% of the points are (between the first and third quartile). Boxplots
draw a box for these values spanning from the first to the third
quartile, with a thick line at the median value.</p>
<p>Here is an example for the variable <code>life_expectancy</code>.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="Boxplot1" data-caption="Code"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>ggplot(world, aes(y = life_expectancy)) +
        geom_boxplot()</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":2,"fig.height":5,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":192,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"default","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>We can easily read the three quartile values from the box. But we
also see that there are a few more visual elements contained in the
boxplot. Vertical lines, the <strong>whiskers</strong>, extend the box
at the bottom/top. Each marks how far the distribution stretches in the
first/fourth quarter. We actually need to discern two different cases,
which we also see in the example: First, if the values in the
first/fourth quartile do not stretch too far, the whisker goes down/up
to the minimum/maximum value (here, this applies to the fourth quartile
above the box). Second, if there are some values that should be rather
considered as outliers, the whisker only stretches to the
minimum/maximum of the non-outliers and outliers are visualized as
separate dots (here, this applies to the first quartile below the box
with a single outlier). Usually, values that are above/below the box
with 1.5 times the distance between the first and third quartile
(<strong>inter-quartile range</strong>) are considered as outliers.</p>
<p>With this you can get a compact overview of the distribution of the
data. It now allows us to visualize multiple boxplots next to each other
comparing different groups of data items. For instance, we can split the
above data distribution by region as follows.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="Boxplot2" data-caption="Code"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>ggplot(world, aes(x = region, y = life_expectancy)) +

</div>
<p>Now, we note that, generally, African countries suffer from lower
life expectancy than all other regions, which have clearly higher
values. However, there are numerous outliers regarding African countries
to the bottom and top. Surprisingly, though, the overall lowest value,
which we already noted as an outlier in the aggregated boxplot above, is
located in the Americas.</p>
<p>To identify the specific countries with the lowest life expectancy,
let us sort the original data table. Here is an example how this works
for listing the top countries by population in decreasing order:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="SortedTable"
data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1"

<div id="section-discussion" class="section level3">
<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>We have seen three ways of visualizing a single numeric variable with
<strong>increasing level of aggregation</strong>, from item bars to
boxplots. First, the item bars show the data pretty much <em>as is</em>
and directly map each numeric value to a single bar. When loading many
data items, this can quickly become too cluttered as there is not enough
space for putting all the labels and bars get very thin. Also, while one
can easily see the general range of data, it is hard to really judge the
distribution of data points. For this, histograms are much better. They
abstract from individual items and show frequency of items regarding a
specific range of values. Here, the range of values as well as peaks
become obvious. Whereas histograms are already use some aggregation,
boxplots go beyond and are even more space-efficient. In a single
column, they show various properties of the data distribution of one
variable. Multiple boxplots can be placed next to each other to compare
subsets of data items regarding one variable.</p>
<p>Our discussion has focused on numerical variables here and
<strong>categorical variables</strong> cannot be visualized just like
that. For instance, for the item bars, there is no numeric value we can
map the height of the bar to. Also, boxplots heavily rely on
characterizing quantitative properties such as quartiles, which are not
available for categorical variables. Histograms, however, can be applied
to categorical data with certain restrictions: We can count for each
category how many data items are assigned and visualize these frequency
values. However there are no bins as categorical scales do not have
ranges. Generally, the sorting of the categories is not clearly defined,
but sorting by alphabetic order or item frequency often makes sense. Let
us give an example here for the number of countries each
<code>region</code> contains, sorted by alphabetic order of regions.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="HistogramCategorical"
data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1"
data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>ggplot(world, aes(x = region)) +

</div>
<p><strong>Misinterpretation and Misuse:</strong> Though being simple,
the above diagrams already might be misinterpreted or even intentionally
misused. For instance, you can sometimes see news articles trick their
readers by cutting the scale of item bars to visually exaggerate
differences and make the story appear more important. Histograms can be
misinterpreted when using too many bins—random variations in the data
will likely cause certain differences of neighboring bars that should
not be interpreted as being relevant. Too few bins can hide relevant
patterns in the data. Since boxplots also aggregate the data, something
similar can be observed here. For instance, if there are several
distinct peaks, the boxplot would hide this within the main rectangle
and appears as if there is a single peak around the shown median value.
Hence, boxplot should only be applied when being sure that the data
distribution has a clear single peak, which can be checked using
histograms.</p>
<p>As an example for <strong>exaggeration of differences</strong>, we
here cut the scale for <code>life_expectancy</code> to values between 55
and 85:</p>

<h2>Multivariate Analysis</h2>
<p>Multivariate analysis deals with many variables simultaneously and
aims at discovering potential relationships, patterns, and unexpected
observations (outliers). One of the most natural and straightforward
visualization for multivariate data is a <strong>tabular
visualization</strong>, similar as already described earlier (<a
href="#section-motivation">Motivation</a>). Simply coloring the cells of
a table according to the cells’ values makes a tabular representation
much more efficient to process and allows finding basic patterns. Still,
relationships between variables might be harder to see and the ability
to show many data items remains limited. In the following, we present
different common visualization techniques that are useful in these
regards for exploring multivariate data.</p>
<div id="section-scatterplots" class="section level3">
<h3>Scatterplots</h3>
<p>With the initial goal to compare the data along two variables, we can
create a scatterplot. It uses <strong>points</strong> to represent
individual values for two numerical variables <strong>in a coordinate
system with two dimensions</strong>. The position of each point in the
coordinate system indicates the values for an individual data item on
the horizontal x-axis (first variable) and vertical y-axis (second
variable).</p>
<p>The following code snippet gives an example of a scatterplot showing
the data points (countries) along <code>income</code> and
<code>life_expectancy</code>.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="scatterplot"
data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1"
data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>ggplot(world, aes(y = life_expectancy, x = income))+ 
        geom_point()</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":7,"fig.height":5,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":672,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"default","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>A scatterplot can reveal unexpected gaps in the data or outliers.
Again, Haiti (represented by the extreme bottom left point) shows as an
outlier for <code>life_expectancy</code>. However, it is an outlier that
follows a general trend. When we look at the plot as a whole, we observe
this trend: As we move from left to right on the horizontal axis for
<code>life_expectancy</code>, we see a general increase in the
<code>income</code> values. We say that the variables are <em>positively
correlated</em> (please note the mathematical concept of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation">correlation</a>).
Negative correlations, hence, would show as decreasing values from left
to right, while other combinations might not show any clear trend at
all.</p>
<p><strong>TASK:</strong> Use the above code block to observe pairwise
relationships (e.g., positive, negative, or no correlation) between
different pairs of variables and try to answer the following
question.</p>

</div>
</div>
<!-- A scatterplot can also reveal different groups (often referred to as **clusters**) of data points based on how similar their values are to other data points. -->
<p>A nice property of scatterplot is that they can be visually extended
to also show data from a few more variables. For instance, we can use
the color of the points to encode <code>region</code> and the size of
the points to visualize <code>population</code>.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="scatterplotGrouping"
data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1"
data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>ggplot(world, aes(x=income, y=babies_per_woman, color=region, size=population))+

</div>
<p>Now, we can see more specific patterns for different regions of the
world. For instance, African women tend to have more babies while
European women are likely to have 2 or fewer babies. Two Asian
countries, China and India (the largest dots), manage to have rather low
birth rates despite their relatively low average income values.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-scatterplot-matrices" class="section level3">
<h3>Scatterplot Matrices</h3>
<p>For a more systematic comparison of variables, a scatterplot matrix
(or a <strong>pairs plot</strong>) shows <strong>all possible
combinations of scatterplots</strong> of the selected variables in a
matrix-like organization. Run the following code snippet to see a
scatterplot matrix of the five numerical variables in our sample
dataset.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="scatterplotMatrix"
data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1"
data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>pairs(world[3:7])</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":7,"fig.height":5,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":672,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"default","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>Please note that the above code block does not use <em>ggplot2</em>,
but the default R diagrams. There is an obvious difference in terms of
aesthetics for this plot compared to the ones you have seen above. There
is not direct <em>ggplot2</em> version of this visualization, but <a
href="https://ggobi.github.io/ggally/"><strong>GGally</strong></a>
extends <em>ggplot2</em> with advanced multivariate plots. The following
code block uses <em>GGally</em> to draw a scatterplot matrix for the
same variables.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="scatterplotMatrixWithGGally"
data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1"
data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>library(GGally)
ggpairs(world[3:7])</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":7,"fig.height":5,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":672,"warning":false,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"default","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>Scatterplots for each pair of variables are drawn on the left of the
diagonal. The values of the <em>Pearson correlation coefficient</em>, a
specific method how to calculate correlations, are shown on the right of
the diagonal. The number of <strong>asterisks</strong> (*) marks the
statisical significance of correlations and can be interpreted as a
measure of certainty (not strength). The diagonal shows the univariate
distribution of each variable.</p>
<p>Now, we can much quicker check the pairwise correlations, both
visually and through the correlation coefficients. For instance, we
observe a strong positive correlation (usually, &gt; 0.75) between
<code>income</code> and <code>health_expenditure</code> and an almost as
strong, but negative correlation between <code>life_expectancy</code>
and <code>babies_per_woman</code>. The scatterplots show in both cases
potentially interesting outliers. Unfortunately, the visualization is
not interactive and does not allow to directly identify the respective
countries, but we can use other means to do this (for instance, sorting
the tabular output).</p>
</div>
<div id="section-parallel-coordinates-plots" class="section level3">
<h3>Parallel Coordinates Plots</h3>
<p>With scatterplots and scatterplot matrices, we are able to see
relationships between variables and outliers as unusual combinations of
values. Sometimes, also groups of similar data items appear as visual
clusters. However, this is limited to two numerical variables at a time.
However, specifically for detecting similar items, it is desirable to
compare more than two numerical variables and see clusters or similarity
within predefined groups across all these data attributes.</p>
<p>A parallel coordinates plot supports such comparison. Here, each
variable corresponds to a vertical axis. The axes for all variables are
placed in parallel and equidistant from each other. A data point is now
represented as a broken line across all axes. The line intersects each
axis at the respective value of the variable for the current data item.
Run the following code snippet to see a parallel coordinates for our
dataset where each line, hence, represents one country.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="firstParallelPlot"
data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1"
data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>ggparcoord(world, columns=3:7, alphaLines = 0.2, scale = &quot;uniminmax&quot;)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":7,"fig.height":5,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":672,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"default","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>Once again, this implementation is based on <em>GGally</em>. We
reduce the opacity of the lines (<code>alphaLines = 0.2</code>) to
better see patterns in dense regions with many line crossings. For a
better scaling, we use a <strong>uni</strong>t <strong>min</strong>imum
and <strong>max</strong>imum (<code>scale = unitminmax</code>) that
normalizes all axes to have a value between 0 and 1.</p>
<p>Now, we get an overview of all data items and all numeric variables.
We can observe whether there exists a similar subset of data items
regarding these attributes. For instance, we see a large group of small
countries with low to medium income and health expenditure, but quite
high life expectancy and middle fertility rates. Still, subtle
difference are difficult to note and it remains unclear which countries
belong to a specific cluster. Coloring the lines by region could maybe
provide more insights.</p>
<p><strong>TASK:</strong> Color the lines by variable
<code>region</code>. <em>Hint:</em> You can consult the <a
href="https://ggobi.github.io/ggally/reference/ggparcoord.html?q=parcoord#arguments">documentation</a>
of <code>ggparcoord</code>.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>In contrast to visualizations like histograms and boxplots, which
aggregate data, the visualization presented in this section do not
aggregate data. Instead, they visualize every observation individually
and patterns appear in the visual distribution of points (scatterplots)
and lines (parallel coordinates plots). Scatterplots only compare two
variables at a time, but can be extended to scatterplot matrices for
visualization of more variables. However, these matrices are still
limited to pairwise comparisons. In contrast, parallel coordinates plots
literally connect more variables.</p>
<p><strong>Scatterplots</strong> are particularly useful for
<strong>observing correlations between variables</strong>. Although they
do not reveal the precise extent of a correlation, they are very helpful
to get a rough understanding of the correlation. This even works when
the relationship is not linear (for instance, first increasing, then
decreasing values as read from left to right), which common numeric
correlation coefficients cannot capture. Also, deviations from the
general trend can quickly be identified as outliers in these
scatterplots.</p>
<p><strong>Parallel coordinates plots</strong> show their strength in
providing an <strong>overview across more variables</strong>. Clusters
can be discovered by identifying density patterns in the patterns of
lines. However, the resulting appearance of the plot depends on the
sorting of the axes. While it is easier to see a group of items with
similar values in three neighboring axes, it is much harder if these
axes are scattered across other axes. Unfortunately, different patterns
might require different orderings—there generally is no perfect
ordering.</p>
<p>In our examples, we have not used <strong>categorical
variables</strong> as axes, neither in scatterplots nor in parallel
coordinates plots, but <strong>for additional color-coding the points
and lines</strong>. This is doable for a single categorical variable. A
second categorical variable can be encoded in the shape of the points or
the stroke of the lines (different styles of dashing). However, this
approach is limited to a few such variables, having only few categories
each. Although just treating the categorical variables as numeric ones
and mapping the categories to numbers is doable, this would result in
scatterplots and parallel coordinates plots that are hard to interpret
as proximity on the scale does no longer have a meaning.</p>
<!-- todo: discuss categorical vars -->
<p><strong>Misinterpretation and Misuse:</strong> Scatterplots might be
misinterpreted to see causation between a pair of variables that are
just correlated, or intentionally misused for this. But keep in mind
that <strong>correlation does not imply causation</strong>. Correlation
is just a statistical relationship between the variable while causation
relates to a phenomenon where one variable truly influences the other as
an effect. Correlation can stem from a causal relationship, but might
also be just a coincidence or caused by a third unseen factor. In
parallel coordinates plots, <strong>the absence of a visual cluster
pattern does not imply the general absence of clusters</strong>—axes
might just need to be reordered to reveal an existing cluster or
clusters are rather subtle so that they are hard to note visually.</p>
